    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic lemonade recipe is the one my mom used to make for me when I was little. Ah, the
       <br> taste of summer! It's the perfect combination of sweet and tart. When using a clear pitcher,
       <br> adding a few of the juiced lemon halves makes it look prettier.
